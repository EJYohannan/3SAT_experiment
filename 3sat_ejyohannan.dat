*Brute Force used*
Answer: 
   Number of clauses satisfied: 10
   Number of iterations: 64
   Values: FFFTTTTTT

*Greedy Hueristic used*
Answer: 
   Number of clauses satisfied: 9
   Number of iterations: 4
   Values: TTTXXXXXX

The reason that the Hueristic fails is that it adds variables
that satisfy the maximum number of remaining clauses in the formula.
In this case, it adds x1, then x2, then x3, which each satisfy 3 clauses.
BUT this prevents the final clause (-x1, -x2, -x3) from being satisfied.
The brute force approach eventually realizes that x1, x2, and x3
cannot all be set to TRUE. It sets x4 through x9 to TRUE instead.
